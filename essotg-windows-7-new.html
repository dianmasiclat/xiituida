It boots up fine, but when I get to the "choose language" page of the Windows 7 installation the rig either freezes or doesn't recognize the mouse or keyboard. I've read that some problems might arise with legacy USB devices, and so I've attempted to get to the BIOS and resolve the issue. When I press "delete" on boot, the screen goes dark and has a singular white dot. I have gotten to the BIOS once during the process, but this was before. 
So I just finished building my first PC and now when Im trying to install Windows 7 with USB it freezes at Starting Windows 7 Logo I tried a CD setup I got still same so I flashed the BIOS to the newest of my mobo and now it goes til the setup https://fthmb.tqn.com/PHYrXvkb072tQEF0LV0_SKh2C0Y=/768x0/filters:no_upscale()/about/windows-7-install-5-58070cd23df78cbc28bed273.jpg But now when I get there my Mouse and Keyboard deactivate I try replugging their USB's only the mouse turns Motherboard on tower unit was replaced with 7th gen CPU (i3-7100).

I have never had this problem. The first time I noticed Hello, I am posting again since no one has answered my question last time. I am having problems using my newly assembled computer. I cannot install updates because there is no internet connection (need drivers) and I cannot install drivers cause it does not recognized the usb storage (no usb listed) I suspect because the usb ports are all 3.0+. I have no HDD or Optical Drives. I would like to add that sometimes the mouse works, sometimes it doesnt at all Please help me fix this problem. Title says it all, I was computer literate once upon a time. When I start the game I choose what directx version and none of them, the box disappears and nothing happens, bought the laptop yesterday, and I'm too old to figure it out myself. Long story short, helped my brother build a pc about 3 years ago, and instead of me keeping the disk, he did and to no surprise the cd is lost is now needed. It was a builders copy, purchased from new egg. is there anything humanly possible that can be done from either windows or newegg to acquire 
TL;DR Dual Monitors, switched from wireless mouse to wired, this ( happens. Long: Switched from Logitech M510 Wireless Mouse ( to Logitech G402 Wired Mouse ( after installing all drivers and updates, when I move my mouse cursor to the right side of my primary monitor (in a dual monitor setup), it can move 'off' the monitor. I'm building a new pc, and decided to use the hard drive from my current pc. The drive boots windows fine in my old pc, but when connected to my new PC I get the error 'Missing Operating System'. So I put the drive back into my old PC, works fine. Put it back into my new one, error. Can anyone help me? And no, I do not have the boot disk/usb. I am installing the OEM version of Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 to my newly built PC and I keep receiving this error during the same point of the "Expanding Windows file" section on the installation. "Windows cannot install required files. Make sure all files required for installation are available, and restart the installation. Error code: 0x8007045D" I will eventually have multiple drives but for the installation I only have my 250gb Samsung 840 SSD plugged in. An internet search indicates. Wife has returned to school this semester after being out for sometime. Her laptop purchased last year before she decided to return to school had Windows 8 (now 8.1), but I've been tasked with setting up Windows 7 on said laptop as she has free licenses from school for Windows 7 Professional. Fresh OS installs are never an issue for me, however, her data backup seems to be a problem. What tool can I use to automate (as much as possible) to backup all of her data outside of the OS? Not worried. I recently got a new motherboard and CPU and need to reinstall Windows 7. I have an SSD with windows 7 already on it and read that repairing the installation rather than redoing it will keep all the data on the drive. I've gotten to the Choose a Recovery Tool window and am trying to figure out which one to choose: Startup Repair, System Restore, System Image Recovery, Windows Memory Diagnostic, or Command Prompt. I'm guessing that the last two are out, but which of the remaining three should. 
I have a laptop which I'm replacing the existing HDD with a SSD. I ultimately want to have a clean (fresh?) install of windows 7 and I have backed up all my important files on an external drive. However, I'm not sure the best way to do this. Should I first copy the existing drive to my new SSD, then go about a clean install? Or, should i physically install the SSD and then perform a clean install on the "blank", "new". Do you guys tried that already, I don't know if I want to risk my whole crypted drive to end up being damaged and then doing the recovery thing. The problem is I think that Windows 8 might damage the startup partition on which TrueCrypt software that asks for password is installed. Help? I am not doing a clean install or anything, just using the automated setup from Microsoft to check out the new system without removing mine. EDIT: So after few minutes of stressful waiting system reboot. I've installed my OS on the SSD and I have booted up, but I'm locked out of the user folder. My desktop folder is pretty big as well, so I was wondering if I could just log in to the user folder on the other drive. So have windows log into the old user profile on the HDD. Is this possible. 
many solutions, many failed answers. many. many. many. I've tried the ie dll for one. It's happened once before, and I tried maybe 6 different "solutions", not saying they didn't work for some, but the problem seems to occur under different conditions, and it's SO annoying when you find a fix that didn't fix your problem, it's just a minor annoyance, reading a solved thread only to try it, and FAIL. anyways. this time, I just did a clone I've got a Asus U56E that used to have a 750GB HDD with Windows 7 Home Premium. Sadly, my HDD crashed and I (very stupidly) never made a backup/system image. I replaced the HDD with an SDD. I went to MS' website to active my product key to get an ISO, but it redirected me to get a recovery disk from the manufacturer. Asus did not supply one, nor do they sell one any more.
