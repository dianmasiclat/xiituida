Озвученный англо-русский словарь: слова Hi all, just wondering if anyone has managed to make Google Cardboard photos (taken with the GC app) accessible on the PSVR?

Like the title says. Is there a way? I would Is it possible to look at Cardboard Camera photos on PSVR? Thank. Is there really no way to share an album of VR photos and videos with someone else and let them see it with their own headset? I just got a Lenovo Mirage Camera and can't find a way to share pics or albums with people so they can view them. This seems like such a simple and important part that I'm hoping I'm just being dense and it's not really missing. Hi, i recently tried cardboard camera and did several photos with a galaxy s7. Later i wanted to see in oculus go but the image was so distorsioned, up and down the image is streched. Could anyone help me or recommend another app to see and do 360 photos? Thanks in advance. 
I have a few 360 photos that I took with the Cardboard camera app. I transferred them to the Oculus Go and I see the preview thumbnail in the gallery under internal storage but they don't open. Sometimes I see a very brief flash of the image and then it pops me back to the home screen. They open fine with my Rift. When I look at the properties of the files they are jpg 9320x1601. Anyone have any insight. Hi! One of the main things I use gearvr for is reliving photos i made with Google's Cardboard Camera. It transforms your phone into a 360° stereo camera. On trips I always take photos with it and then later I can watch them in my gearvr. Is there a way to edit Cardboard Camera's .vr files? I'd like to take a vr pic of a garden from the app export/open it in say Photoshop or Illustrator to add floating tags for plants so others can look around the garden & see what's there. I am not looking for parallax effect or anything fancy for the tags. Alternately, if there's another way to do this I am open to it too. Thanks I have two phones where the Google cardboard camera either doesn't focus OR you can't take a panorama when the picture is focused. LG G2: After I focus the picture to start the panorama, nothing happens when I press the red record button. LG Q6: When clicking in the middle of the picture, the view is not focused. All panoramas as therefore blurred. Has anybody here has the same problems? Are there solutions or alternative apps to make "VR" panoramas (not whole 360°). Has anyone found a way to do this? I'm able to view my 360 photos in oculus 360 when I move my cardboard camera pics to the OculusPhotos folder. However, none of them play the sound that was captured along with them. Is there another app or tool I can use to view these WITH sound. So one of the reasons I got this phone was because of it's Daydream compatibility and one of my favorite things to do is to use the Cardboard Camera app to take panoramic, stereo 3D vr photos to look at later. Because this uses a single camera slowly pivoting 360 degrees, this usually means you lose the top and bottom of the image (sky and ground to give perspective). However, it seems that the Cardboard Camera app uses the wide angle lens instead of the main lens so you actually I'm thinking about making a game around this concept and I was wondering if anyone has an experience 
Hi! I really like cardboard camera but i cant view photos made with it in my gearvr only by disabling vr service. Is there I've taken a few pictures with Cardboard Camera, but they're kinda boring (e.g., my kitchen). How can I find VR pictures that other people have taken, e.g., of the Grand Canyon. I just recently decided to start playing with Google's Cardboard Camera app and am wondering if any of the common VR Media players are supporting those files directly yet, or if there's a straightforward way to convert them to a supported format. Appatently they're not your run-of-the-mill 360 spherical images but in a different aspect ratio, can include audio, and maybe some other differences. Hello, I have a request to make to the Google Cardboard community here on Reddit. Would any of you guys be willing to send me some of the photos you have captured with Cardboard Camera? I am creating a VR app for some under-privileged children and one of the features that I want to have is a map of the world where they will be able to click on places on the map and see a 360 view of the place. For this, I will need several cardboard photos. I already have the system
